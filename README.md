# Lambda School Machine Learning Mini Bootcamp (LSMLMBC) Day 3

1. Machine Learning = Function Optimization
  * y = f(x)
  * A map: y = f(x) for some x
  * A function: y = f(x) for every x
  * A function is a table of values
  * A function is a graph
2. Functions convert information from one type to another
  * y = a result
  * x = a data sample
3. Functions have many shapes
  * linear
  * polynomial
  * exp/log
  * ... more!
3. Machine Learning = Derivative Computation
  * dy/dx(f(x))
  * Where the derivative changes direction is an optimum
  * Optima
    * Either the place where the answer is or:
    * The place where you are stuck on the wrong answer

# Assignment:

Start with the LSMLMBC github assignment: https://github.com/LambdaSchool/ML-Precourse. The rest of the information you need will be delivered tomorrow. Send a pull request with your completed assignment after the lesson tomorrow.
